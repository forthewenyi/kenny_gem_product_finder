Durability Score Calculator for Kenny Gem Finder
Calculates a 0-100 durability score based on 4 components:
- 40 points: Longevity Reports (how long users keep it)
- 25 points: Failure Rate (what % still works after 5+ years)
- 20 points: Repairability (can you fix it?)
- 15 points: Material Quality Indicators

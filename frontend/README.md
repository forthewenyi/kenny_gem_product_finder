## Key Features

### 1. Search & Discovery

**Two Types of Filters:**

#### Search Input Filters (Pre-Search)
- **Value Preference**: User's value approach (Save Now, Best Value, Buy for Life)
- Only passed to backend when Search button is clicked
- No auto-triggering - simple state management

#### Result Filters (Post-Search)
FilterBar component with 6 filter types:
- **Value**: Good/Better/Best tier filtering
- **Price**: Range slider for maximum upfront price
- **Brand**: Toggle buttons for all brands in results
- **Material**: Toggle buttons for product materials
- **Features**: Toggle buttons for characteristics (dynamically generated from backend)

- Active filters displayed as removable pills
- Clear all functionality

### 3. AI Buying Guidance

- **Product Detail Modal**: Comprehensive view with value breakdown, quality data, practical metrics, sources
- Good/Better/Best tier organization
- Kenny's Pick highlighting (best value in Better tier)

### 5. Comparison View
- **VALUE Framework Organization**: 4 sections aligned with product evaluation criteria
- **No Duplicates**: Single source of truth for price, lifespan, recommendations
- Apple-style side-by-side comparison (up to 3 products)
- Sections:
  1. 🔨 **PRODUCT** (Physical Quality & What You Get): brand, materials, key_features, why_its_a_gem, quality metrics
  2. 🛠️ **SERVICE** (Support & Usability Over Time): learning_curve, maintenance, honest drawbacks
  3. 💎 **EQUITY** (Trust & Long-term Value Retention): professional_reviews, best_for
  4. 💰 **PRICE & ACTION**: value breakdown (price, lifespan, cost/year, cost/day), purchase links

## Recent Changes

### Nov 5, 2025 - VALUE Framework Comparison Reorganization
**Updated:**
- ✅ **Comparison Section Reorganization** (`app/HomePageContent.tsx:424-663`)
  - Reorganized from 7 sections into 4 VALUE framework sections
  - 🔨 **PRODUCT**: brand, materials, key_features, why_its_a_gem, quality metrics
  - 🛠️ **SERVICE**: learning_curve, maintenance, honest drawbacks (renamed from trade-offs)
  - 💎 **EQUITY**: professional_reviews (now displayed!), best_for
  - 💰 **PRICE & ACTION**: value breakdown, purchase links
- ✅ **Added Professional Reviews**: Now displayed in EQUITY section (was missing in previous version)
- ✅ **Renamed "Trade-offs" → "Honest Drawbacks"**: More transparent terminology
- ✅ **Supports both field names**: Uses `drawbacks` field with fallback to `trade_offs` for backward compatibility

### Nov 4, 2024 - Product Detail Modal & Comparison Reorganization
**Added:**
- ✅ **ProductDetailModal**: Comprehensive product view with all backend data
  - Value breakdown (price, cost/year, cost/day, lifespan)
  - Quality & durability metrics (score, repairability, failure points)
  - Practical day-to-day use details (cleaning, setup, maintenance)
  - Materials, characteristics, best for, trade-offs
  - Source transparency with clickable research links
- ✅ **AI Buying Characteristics**: Backend integration via `characteristic_generator`
  - Multi-select filtering (select multiple characteristics simultaneously)
  - Fuzzy matching between AI labels and product features
  - Visual feedback with selected badges and product counts
- ✅ **Comparison Section Reorganization**: Streamlined from 12 to 7 sections
  - Eliminated duplicate information (lifespan, price, why_its_a_gem, best_for)
  - Consolidated related data into logical groupings
  - Improved scanability and decision-making flow
- ✅ **ProductCard Design Update**: Native design system consistency
  - Added explicit borders and ring-2 selection pattern
  - Separated onClick (comparison) vs onViewDetails (modal) handlers
  - Updated instruction text for clarity

**Code Changes:**
- 11 files changed, 743 insertions(+), 336 deletions(-)

### Nov 3, 2024 - Filter System Refactor
**Problem:**
- Hard-coded SIZE, SURFACE, FEATURES filters from `/config/productCharacteristics.ts`
- Auto-triggering searches on filter changes (frustrating 93s waits)
- Confusing mix of search input filters and result filters

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removed all hard-coded product characteristics
- ✅ Simplified to single input filter: Value Preference (lazy - no auto-trigger)
- ✅ Result filters dynamically generated from backend `aggregated_characteristics`
- ✅ Clear visual separation between filter types
- ✅ Simple `useState` for all filter state
- ✅ Removed focus ring artifacts (green rectangles)

**Code Reduction:**
- Total: ~1,058 lines removed, 487 lines added
